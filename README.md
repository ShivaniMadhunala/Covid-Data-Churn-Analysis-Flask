# Segmentation-and-Churn-Analysis-of-Insurance-Data
Churn Analysis/ Flask framework
Nowadays, the entire insurance application process is very lengthy. Usually it takes an insurance company about 15-30 days as they have a lot of details they have to go through like health, wealth, and family history. So to speed up this process a segmentation of the customer base for the insurance company is done. We have done SMOTE preprocessing and applied a plethora of Machine Learning algorithms to get the best accuracy.
Most insurance companies spend about 30 percent of their total revenue of advertisements, so we developed a churn analysis tool that may help the company identify whether the customer leaves the insurance company or not. Such that they can cater to this customer base and provide them better benefits. We have applied ANN of this data to get the best results.
The goal is to deploy both these applications on a website using Flask.
